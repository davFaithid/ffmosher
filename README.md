 Datamoshing with FFmpeg

Drag and drop video onto `mosh.bat` to create a datamoshed video.

To datamosh an image, please ensure the file is in a `bitmap (.bmp)` format.

Then simply run 

```
py -3 input.bmp output.bmp
```

## Note

Currently this is just a proof of concept. In future I will allow for customizable filters.

At the moment any outputted video is mute.
